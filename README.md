Rat King Adventure is expansive fork of [RKPD2](https://github.com/Zrp200/rkpd2/releases), introducing a lot of new content:
- Brand new area after Yog, the Abyss, with difficult enemies and endless length
- Tier-6 weapons with many interesting effects
- New challenges unlocked with already existing challenges to explore drawbacks to player's power
- Rat enemies living in dungeon and replacing other common enemies
- Huge expansion on talent side of the game, including tier-4 talents
- Expanded concept of secret subclasses for each subclass in the game
- Chaotic and unpredictable Kromers with high risk and high reward

RKPD2 is forked from the [source code of Shattered Pixel Dungeon](https://github.com/00-evan/shattered-pixel-dungeon/) by [00-Evan](https://shatteredpixel.com/), inspired by Rat King Dungeon by the same author.

This will remain in sync with updates coming from RKPD2 and ShatteredPD for the foreseeable future.

Rat King Adventure currently compiles for Android and desktop platforms. It is currently only available from [GitHub](https://github.com/TrashboxBobylev/Rat-King-Adventure), but it may expand to other distribution sites such as Google Play in the future.
